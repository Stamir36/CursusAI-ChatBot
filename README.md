## What for and why?
Anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and wants to try different models, you are in the right place. This repository has a script for launching a neural model in two modes: in the console and in Cursus Messenger.

>Those who want to try to communicate with the model without installing and running scripts, you can go to https://unesell.com/app/cursus/ and chat with the neural network.

## Guides

Check out the following resources to help you get started with neural chatbots:

- [Cursus Messenger](https://unesell.com/app/cursus/) - Try Chatbot Online (If the script is currently running on at least one computer)
- [Unesell API](https://api.unesell.com/#aimodels) - Instructions for running the script on the local computer.
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) - Here you can find any other model to run.

Download the model launch script

```sh
wget https://api.unesell.com/AI/run.py
wget https://api.unesell.com/AI/run.1B.py
```
>The first script with 400M model, the second one with 1B. Choose the one that your local machine can pull.

Install dependencies and run the script

```sh
python -m pip install torch transformers requests langdetect
```
To run in [browser interface](https://unesell.com/app/cursus/)
