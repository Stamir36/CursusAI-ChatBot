## What for and why?
Anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and wants to try different models, you are in the right place. This repository has a script for launching a neural model in two modes: in the console and in Cursus Messenger.

>Those who want to try to communicate with the model without installing and running scripts, you can go to https://unesell.com/app/cursus/ and chat with the neural network.
